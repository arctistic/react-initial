# React

## Notes
React CDN
    1. src link: what does it have?
        - React Code
    2. Why 2 script files?
        - 1st file ->  react.development.js -> core react
        - 2nd file -> react-dom.development.js -> dom operations
    3. Why not have 1 file instead?
        - React does not only work on browers
            - ReactNative
